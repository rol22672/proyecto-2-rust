# ðŸŒ´ **Island Scene Ray Tracing Project**

This project is a simple ray tracing simulation that renders an **Island Scene** using colored cubes. The island consists of a small beach house, a palm tree, a sandy ground, and a surrounding water body. The ray tracing algorithm is written in Rust, and it uses simple 3D graphics to create an engaging scene that can be navigated with mouse controls.

## ðŸ›  **Project Features**

- **Ray Tracing:** Uses a basic ray tracing algorithm to render 3D objects in real-time.
- **Island Scene Elements:** Includes water, sand, a palm tree, and a small house, all created using colored cubes.
- **Mouse Navigation:** Allows you to navigate around the scene using mouse movements.
- **Performance Optimization:** Utilizes solid colors instead of textures to ensure smooth performance on limited resources.

## ðŸ’» **Technologies Used**

- **Rust:** Programming language used for implementing the ray tracing logic.
- **Winit & Pixels:** Libraries used for handling window creation, input events, and pixel rendering.
- **Nalgebra:** Used for vector and matrix calculations essential for 3D rendering.
